## NER
The purpose of the provided code is to demonstrate the process of Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Machine Learning techniques. Named entities refer to real-world objects like persons, places, organizations, or products that have a name. NER is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task aimed at identifying and classifying named entities within a given text.

The code loads a dataset containing text data and corresponding named entity tags. It preprocesses the data by transforming it into a format suitable for training a neural network model. This involves mapping words and tags to numerical indices and padding sequences to ensure uniform length.

Next, a Bidirectional LSTM neural network model is defined and trained on the prepared dataset. The model architecture consists of embedding layers, bidirectional LSTM layers, and a time-distributed dense layer for predicting entity tags. The training process involves iterating over the dataset for multiple epochs to optimize the model parameters.

Finally, the trained model is used to perform NER on a sample text using the spaCy library. The named entities recognized by the model are visualized using spaCy's visualization tools.

Overall, the code provides a comprehensive example of how to implement NER with Machine Learning techniques, from data preparation to model training and evaluation.
